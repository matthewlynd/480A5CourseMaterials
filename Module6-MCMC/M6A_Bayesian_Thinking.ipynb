        "In this lecture we will learn how to perform Bayesian inference in practice to estimate model parameters from data. This will involve most of the things we learned in the course so far, as well as a new technique, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). MCMC is the current state-of-the-art approach to deal with complicated probability distributions, and as a result it is one of the cornerstones of modern scientific computing. Our goal in this module is to understand the idea behind MCMC, to apply it to a simple example or two, and to combine it with the Chemical Master Equation to do some inference.\n",

        "Biological experiments are often slow and costly, and due to the delicate nature of living cells we cannot directly measure many of the things we care about. And when we do manage to measure them, these measurements are often subject to a lot of noise - we saw this in our analysis of smFISH microscopy images. If we want to study biology, therefore, we need to be careful about the conclusions we draw given imperfect data. Bayesian statistics provides a general framework that allows us to deal with the noise and uncertainty we encounter in practice.\n",

        "\n",
        "Here $x$ is quantity that we wish to infer, and $\\mathcal{Data}$ is our data. Bayes' Theorem tells us how observing $\\mathcal{Data}$ affects our knowledge of the true quantity $x$, based on our prior knowledge of $x$ represented by the prior $p(x)$, and the predictions of the model, represented by the likelihood $p(\\mathcal{Data} \\, | \\, x)$. \n",
        "\n",

        "The normalization constant is an integral of the probability of the observed data over *all* possible values of $x$.  In other words, this is the total probability that we would observe the data under *any* possible model explanation. The reason for this normalization constant is that, in order for us to know whether a specific model (i.e., $x$) is a good explanation of our data, we need to consider how well that explanation performs relative to all other possible explanations that could have given the same data.\n",
