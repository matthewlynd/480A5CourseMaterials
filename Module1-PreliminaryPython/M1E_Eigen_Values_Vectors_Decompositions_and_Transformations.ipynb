    "### Combining multiple sequential transformation steps\n",
    "Notice in the previous example, that we had to take three steps: \n",
    "*(1) we translated the data to place the center of rotation at (0,0), \n",
    "*(2) we rotated all the vectors about the origin (0,0), and then \n",
    "*(3) we translated back to the original origin.\n",
    " \n",
    " With clever application of linear algebra, we can do all three of these steps in one go using an Affine Transformation Matrix which can be constructed as the product of multiple transformation matrixes. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the initial translation:\n",
    "$\n",
    "M1 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 0 & -\\Delta x\\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & -\\Delta y\\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the first row describes how $x$ changes, the second row describes how $y$ changes, and the third row shows how a hidden third variable changes. You could think of this as $z$ or a bias magnitude - either way, it will remain constant at one.  Similarly, the first column is how the new coordinate **depends** on $x$, the second is how the new coordinate depends on $y$ and the third how it depends on the bias.  Because this just a simple shift, $x$ and $y$ take on thier original values plus a multiple of the bias term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define the rotation about the origin.\n",
    "$M2 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\cos(\\theta) & -\\sin(\\theta) & 0\\\\\n",
    "\\sin(\\theta) & \\cos(\\theta) & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second transformation, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are rotated independent of the $z$/bias term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we define the final translation.\n",
    "$\n",
    "M3 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 0 & \\Delta x\\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & \\Delta y\\\\\n",
